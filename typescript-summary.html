<h1>Typescript Summary</h1>

<article>
<p>
  Typescript (TS) is an extension of Javascript, whole sole purpose is to give programmers write managed code. 
  Managed code? What do you mean? 
  By managed code, what I mean is that - Seasoned JS developers will tell you that JS is like an open ground for making mistakes. The code doesnt get compiled unlike C#/Java, which doesnt give you compile time errors, so that you can correct much of your code at compile time.
  Plus, a variable can be set to any type, and that can give u a hell lot of errors on run time, which also makes it hard to debug at times.
  
  So TS takes you from JS to a much more managed code writing environment. Mind it! its writing environment, NOT running enviroment.
  
  TS will eventually get transpiled into JS when you want it to execute it on browser.
