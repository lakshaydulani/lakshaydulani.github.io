<h3>Hey there!</h3>

<p>I am Lakshay Dulani from Delhi, India.</p>
<p>I write mobile apps for EY India (have to :( ) and build some stuff & read about Infosec in my free time!</p>

<p>I like to work on JS, Cordova, Ionic and .NET, Node for backend.</p>

<p>Also I have great interest in AR and try building some stuff in it!</p>
 

<p>I blog my experiences here on <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@lakshaydulani">Medium</a> and can be seen retweeting cat videos here at 
  <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/bholechature">Twitter</a>!</p>

<p>Some of THOSE stuff are -</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="www.cssfiddler.com">cssfiddler.com</a> - Its a Web and Mobile app that lets beginners understand CSS better. Rather than giving just theory, it empasizes on getting hands on code.</li>
